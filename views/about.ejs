        <p>A popular feature of many platforms and apps is livestreaming. This enables users to create and share video content in real-time just like live television. Livestreamers get to be “in the moment” and participate live at an event wherever they are in the world.

            Before the advent of Twitch streams and live YouTube videos, livestreaming was a spontaneous activity. People would just whip out their mobile phones, point the camera at themselves, hit the record button and start talking. Audio and video quality back then was just average, and livestream broadcasters didn’t pay a lot of to attention to the output.
            
            Fast forward to today, livestreaming is now powerful and complex. People use it to communicate with their audience and even earn money.
            
            Some livestreamers make goofs that ruin their hard-earned reputation or make them look like an idiot. These situations are what you call livestream fails.
            
            Top KEK is slang for instances when streamers on YouTube, Twitch or other platforms make a boo-boo on camera. These moments have created a community centered in the /r/LivestreamFail subreddit.</p>
